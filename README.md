# covid-data-analysis

Some quick and dirty graphs for the US and for Washington by county, using the data published by NYT repository
(https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

Main idea is to compare states at once, as well as counties in the state of Washington.
For this, I used
* a simple linear count to see how they compare;
* a log(2) count to see what the doubling rate was like
